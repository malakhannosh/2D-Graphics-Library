# Graphics Library
2D graphics library built for Fall 2023 COMP 475 - 2D Computer Graphics course taught by Mike Reed at UNC Chapel Hill.

The images generated by my code can be found in the images folder.
All code found in the folders (src, include, apps) was authored by Mike Reed, the rest was authored by me.

The graphics engine was built over the course of a semester and I worked extensively with the LLDB debugger to problem solve and correct errors.

Throughout this project I learned to manipulate pixel matrices and calculate color conversions. I also learned to work with shaders and gradients.
